      - question: What is accreditation?
        answer: 
          - line: "Accreditation is the endorsement by an authoritative body (such as SAC) of an organisation's competence, credibility, independence and integrity in carrying out its conformity assessment activities, such as testing, calibration, inspection and certification."
      - question: What is the difference between accreditation and certification?
        answer: 
          - line: "<b>Accreditation</b>: Accreditation is the formal recognition by an accreditation authority to the technical and organisational competence of a conformity assessment body to carry out a specific service in accordance to the standards and technical regulations as described in their scope of accreditation."
          - line: "<b>Certification</b>: Certification is the procedure by which a third party gives written assurance that a product, process, system or person conforms to specified requirements."
          - line: 'ILAC and  IAF have published an informative article titled <a href="http://ilac.org/?download=119879" target="_blank">"Standards, Conformity Assessment and Accreditation: the Pillars of Assurance in the Global Marketplace"</a> in <i>Standards Engineering</i>, a bimonthly journal from the Society of Standards Professionals (SES). It explains the differences between standards, certification and accreditation, and how they form the framework to deliver confidence to regulators, industry and end-users.'
      - question: What are the benefits of being accredited?
        answer: 
          - line: "Through the various mutual recognition arrangements between accreditation bodies, overseas markets will accept your company more readily if they know that you have been certified by an SAC-accredited certification body or accept your test results/inspections if you are an accredited laboratory or inspection body."
          - line: "<b>Minimises Risk:</b> Accredited organisations reduce the risk of providing unreliable test results, services and products, and are able to meet the customers' expectations."
          - line: "<b>Reduce Costs</b>: Although accreditation comes at a cost, the cost savings that result from being accredited will outweigh the cost of accreditation. Cost savings may result from improved productivity, reduced downtime, less re-testing, etc."
          - line: "<b>Demonstrate Credibility</b>: No organisation will want to spend money on getting a report or certificate that has not been accredited by a competent body. An SAC-accredited organisation is able to demonstrate competence for the report or certificate through its sound management system and the use of trained and competence personnel."
      - question: What are the types of SAC accreditation schemes?
