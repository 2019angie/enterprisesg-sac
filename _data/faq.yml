      - question: What is accreditation?
        answer: "Accreditation is the endorsement by an authoritative body (such as SAC) of an organisation's competence, credibility, independence and integrity in carrying out its conformity assessment activities, such as testing, calibration, inspection and certification."
      - question: What is the difference between accreditation and certification?
        answer: "<b>Accreditation:</b> Accreditation is the formal recognition by an accreditation authority to the technical and organisational competence of a conformity assessment body to carry out a specific service in accordance to the standards and technical regulations as described in their scope of accreditation.<p><b>Certification:</b> Certification is the procedure by which a third party gives written assurance that a product, process, system or person conforms to specified requirements.</p><p>ILAC and  IAF have published an informative article titled "Standards, Conformity Assessment and Accreditation: the Pillars of Assurance in the Global Marketplace" in Standards Engineering, a bimonthly journal from the Society of Standards Professionals (SES). It explains the differences between standards, certification and accreditation, and how they form the framework to deliver confidence to regulators, industry and end-users.</p>"
        
- faq-section: Singapore GLP Compliance Programme
  faq:
      - question: What is the difference between GLP recognition and ISO/IEC 17025 accreditation?
        answer: "GLP is a quality system concerned with the organisation process and conditions under which the non-clinical studies are planned, recorded, archived and reported. ISO/IEC 17025 accreditation is a formal recognition for technical competence to undertake specific tests or calibrations. In general GLP is used for non-clinical health & safety studies that are often called for in regulations while ISO/IEC 17025 accreditation is used normally voluntary. Laboratory accreditation to ISO/IEC 17025 is for routine testing and measurement while GLP covers often a series of experiments. Only GLP recognition can provide an effective quality system that gives regulators the necessary confidence in relation to how non-clinical health and safety studies are planned, performed, monitored, recorded, reported and archived."
      - question: Why should I seek GLP Recognition with SAC?
        answer: "Any facility claiming to be in compliance with the Principles of Good Laboratory Practice of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) under the Singapore compliance-monitoring programme must be recognised by SAC for that compliance.<p>In 1981, a decision of OECD Council, data generated in an OECD member country under its national compliance monitoring programme is accepted in other OECD member countries for the purposes of product registration (Mutual Acceptance of Data). Since January 2010, Singapore has been accepted as a non-OECD member country to be a member of the OECD Mutual Acceptance of Data framework. With this adherence, GLP studies conducted in Singapore will be accepted in more than 30 OECD and non-OECD member countries.</p><p> Product registration in overseas markets are typically referred to the US FDA for pharmaceuticals and the European authority (EMEA). In Singapore, the relevant registration authorities are Health Sciences Authority (HSA for pharmaceuticals), Agri-Food & Veterinary Authority (AVA for biologics and agricultural chemicals) and National Environment Agency (NEA for pesticides and industrial chemicals). With the MAD adherence, the Singapore GLP Compliance programme will provide greater assurance of test data for non-clinical studies. These regulators will be able to accept the test data with confidence in the assessment of health and safety for product approvals.</p>"
