### What is Accreditation?

Accreditation is the endorsement of an organisation’s competence, credibility, independence and integrity against both national and international standards. It effectively evaluates the organisation’s ability in carrying out testing, inspection, calibration and certification services.

SAC is a Mutual Recognition Arrangement (MRA) Signatory to various international organisations including ILAC, IAF, APLAC, PAC. The SAC’s mark on test, calibration, inspection reports and certificates will mean that the report is recognised among the MRA partners. Thus, if your services are accredited by SAC, your accredited services will be recognised by the importing countries who are members signatory of the MRA.
