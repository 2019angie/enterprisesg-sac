### What is Accreditation?

Accreditation enhances the credibility of laboratory tests, inspection, certification reports and certificates by providing reliable third party assurance that these services are conducted professionally and meet globally-recognised standards. Conformity Assessment Bodies (CABs) – such as testing and calibration laboratories, as well as certification and inspection bodies – are benchmarked against international standards. This ensures the competency, impartiality and performance capability of their services.

SAC is a Mutual Recognition Arrangement (MRA) Signatory to various international organisations including ILAC, IAF, APLAC, PAC. The SAC’s mark on test, calibration, inspection reports and certificates will mean that the report is recognised among the MRA partners. Thus, if your services are accredited by SAC, your accredited services will be recognised by the importing countries who are members signatory of the MRA.
