## Tip for Businesses

### How Do You Identify a SAC Accredited Conformity Assessment Body?

You can identify a SAC accredited conformity assessment body (CAB) by SAC accreditation marks as proof of accreditation. Accredited reports or certificates carry the SAC mark, along with the unique SAC accreditation certificate number. 

In addition, an accredited test or inspection report will include the following statement:

_"The results reported herein have been performed in accordance with the terms of accreditation under the Singapore Accreditation Council."_

Accreditation is granted for a specific scope of activities and not for all activities undertaken by the CABs. Thus, accredited CABs are only allowed to issue accredited reports for those tests, calibrations or inspections, or issue accredited certificates for the specific certification scopes which they have been accredited.
