# Mission and Strategic Outcomes
![SACStrategicPlan2020](/images/SACStrategic2020.png)

# Impartiality Policy
SAC is committed to safeguard and assure the impartiality of its accreditation activities at strategic and operational levels. SAC will not allow commercial, financial and other pressures to compromise impartiality. SAC ensures its committees operate with balanced views and representations from key stakeholders and interested parties without permitting any one interest to predominate or receive favour.

# Financing
SAC is a not-for-profit establishment. SACâ€™s main source of revenue is from fees collected from conformity assessment bodies as well as from its training activities. Any deficit of SAC will be funded through Enterprise Singapore.
