SAC held its Assessors Enclave on 5 November 2014 at the Holiday Inn Orchard City Centre. The event was well attended by about 100 assessors from the Calibration & Measurement, Chemical & Biological, Environmental, Civil Engineering, Mechanical and Electrical Testing fields, as well as assessors from Site Investigation, Hook-Lift & Container Inspection.

In the first session, SAC updated the assessors on the various changes within SAC and at the international front.  Updates were provided on changes in the Accreditation Management System (SACiNet), Traceability of Measurement (SAC-SINGLAS 006) and Policy and Requirements for Proficiency Testing Programmes (PROF-001).
 
For the second half of the session, the assessors were grouped into specific areas for discussion and sharing on common assessment findings.

The Enclave ended with a lovely buffet lunch at “Windows on the Park” Cafe. Overall, the feedback for the Enclave was positive and all the assessors had enjoyed themselves in socialising and sharing of experiences.
