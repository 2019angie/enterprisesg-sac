## Introduction - Why Markdown and YAML?

Traditionally, in order to edit a website, one had to write in pure HTML. This is challenging for website administrators who had limited experience with HTML as it is not immediately readable or intuitive to non-experienced users. 

Our team decided to go with Markdown (.md) – more human readable syntax – so as to empower non-technical website administrators.

While Markdown is appropriate for writing long segments of text, it alone does not allow users to edit small details of the website (e.g. change the hero-banner image) without diving into the HTML.

We therefore chose to supplement the Markdown syntax with YAML (.yml) – yet another human readable syntax.

Please refer to the [isomer markdown documentation](https://isomer.gov.sg/documentation/markdown/markdown-usage/) to learn more about Markdown syntax.
