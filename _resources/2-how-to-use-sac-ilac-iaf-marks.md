## General Conditions on Use of Accreditation Marks

1. The Accreditation Mark is illustrated below and the appropriate artwork shall be reproduced accurately without any alteration subject to provisions of this clause.

2. The entire Mark may be uniformly enlarged or reduced, but shall not be less than 15mm in height. The SAC accreditation mark shall always be used in its original, designed proportions and not to be distorted, compressed or stretched in any way. The
certificate number must be readable. It shall be used on a background that will not impede readability and only be used in its normal horizontal orientation and not be rotated.

3. The accreditation marks must be reproduced in the official colours, red (Pantone 032C) or dark grey (Pantone
432C). Single colour accreditation marks, subjective to SACâ€™s approval, can be used for limited colour or black and white production, only on light backgrounds. The font used for the certificate number is Univers 65 Bold. When this font is not readily available using software such as Microsoft Office or on platforms such as websites, Arial Bold can be used in its place. When an accredited organisation is accredited for more than 1 programme/field, the accredited organisation can choose to list all certificate numbers under 1 SAC mark, after obtaining approval from SAC in writing.

5. When the SAC accreditation mark is used by an accredited certification body, the appropriate certificate number accorded to the body under the programme shall be used in conjunction with the SAC accreditation mark.

6. The Mark shall not be used by Certified organisations that implies the certification applies to activities that are outside the scope of certification as detailed in the certificate. There shall be no ambiguity in the Mark or accompanying text, as to what has been certified.

7. The Certified Organisation shall ensure that the Mark was not used by its subsidiaries or associates not related to this accredited management system for its product approval or associated documentations.
